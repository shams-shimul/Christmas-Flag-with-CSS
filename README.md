# Christmas Flag with CSS

**🎯 JavaScriptmas 2024 challenge from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/ "target=_blank"), Day 10**

### Backstory
Santa Clause 🎅, Mrs. Clause, the elves 🧝, and the reindeer 🦌 are declaring their new republic, *the Republic of Christmas*, in the North Pole. Mrs. Clause, who has been taking many UI design lessons online, has already designed the Christmas flag. Take a look at the this beautiful design with the festive colors of Christmas:
